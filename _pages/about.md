My name is Yuan Zhao.
I graduated from [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://daytonabeach.erau.edu/) in Daytona Beach, FL, USA with a master's degree in aerospace engineering focusing on aerodynamics.

Throughout my academic journey, I undertook numerous projects centered around aircraft design and analysis, including both preliminary and detailed design phases. Utilizing CATIA V5, I successfully generated intricate aircraft components such as wings and fuselage, and further conducted structural and aerodynamic analyses to validate the design's integrity. During my masterâ€™s program, I made many 3-D wing models to research the effect of fixed-slot on wing performance, which provided me with practical experience.

As a recent graduate, I am eager to transition my academic prowess into practical experience within the aerospace industry. While the journey to secure my first opportunity has been challenging, my unwavering determination propels me forward. My genuine passion for aviation fuels my relentless pursuit of opportunities. I am excited about the possibility of contributing my skills and dedication to the aerospace industry.

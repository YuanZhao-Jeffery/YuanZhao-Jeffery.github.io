# CFD analysis of inviscid flow over bump
Create a MATLAB script implementing FTCS and MacCormack Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) schemes, focusing on simplified Navier-Stokes Equations. This script aims to analyze the inviscid flow over a bump, examining both subsonic (M=0.3) and supersonic (M=2.0) scenarios.

# Aerodynamics analysis of Airbus A320
Utilized Pointwise to generate a refined 3-D mesh grid encompassing the fuselage, wings, and additional components of the Airbus A320. Subsequently, conducted a comprehensive simulation and analysis of the aircraft's performance under transonic conditions, specifically at an altitude of 40,000 feet. This simulation was executed using Ansys Fluent. The focus of this endeavor was to gain insight into the intricate aerodynamic interactions and behavior of the Airbus A320, particularly in the transonic regime.

# Aircraft Detailed Design: Canard analysis
Develop and assess the canard configuration for a real prototype Light-Sport aircraft. Determine the structural properties of the canard section and analyze various critical load scenarios, encompassing conditions like gust spectra, maneuver spectra, as well as landing and taxiing spectra, representative of diverse flight conditions.

# Aircraft Preliminary Design: Business jet
Develop a twin-turbofan-powered business jet capable of accommodating a total of 12 passengers, along with a cockpit crew of two and a dedicated cabin attendant. This business jet operates at an optimal cruising altitude of 36,000 feet, achieving a maximum velocity of Mach 0.8, while boasting an impressive travel range of 4000 nautical miles.
